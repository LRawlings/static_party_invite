        <h1 class="title" align="center">So we got married last year.......</h1>
        <p>And now we would like you to come celebrate with us!</p>
        <p>The riot starts at 1pm on 17<sup>th</sup> August 2019. The marquee will be based just outside of Rhayader.</p>
        <p>See the Location for more details of the exact location, also check out the accommodation......if you are brave feel free to bring your tent.</p>
        <p>All dogs welcome but children must be kept on leads.</p>
        <h2>BYOB</h2>
        <p>There will be no cash bar on site so please bring any booze with you. Rhayader only has a small Co-op so best to stock up before you leave.</p>
        <h2>Gifts</h2>
        <p>Please, no gifts. Bring only your company, appetite and dancing shoes.</p>
        <h2>Dress Code</h2>
        <p>Heels not advised, we will be on the grass and the nearest A&E is 1.5 hours away! Luke will be suiting up, Tanis will be wearing the dress again, but please come as you feel comfortable and possibly warmer clothes as after all it is in Wales.</p>
        <h2>RSVP</h2>
        <p>Please RSVP by 31<sup>st</sup> May 2019 because if you don’t we will throw you in the river!</p>
